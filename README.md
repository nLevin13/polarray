# POLARRAY
2D Arrays, Reimagined


## What is this?
Polarray is an idea to reimagine the way you think and use arrays in certain use cases. Polarray is not intended to ever replace the use of the original array. Its use derives primarily from the idea of how we as humans approach looking at a set of data.

In many cases, if we are faced with a set of data (say a group of objects), we'll unconsciously just swerve our head around in a circular manner. Essentially, my argument is that sometimes it makes more sense to approach a dataset from the center out (r=0 to r=n) as opposed to left to right, top to down. 

## Why doesn't it work/ Why is there no code?
At its current state, Polarray is just an idea. I'm currently working on an actual implementation, and once I have something I'm proud of, I'll put forth an actual release.

## Why make a Github Repository?
To document my ideas, to see if someone else would like to assist in creating this project (contributors will be named), and to store any code I end up writing.

## What Language will this be made in?
I intend to support as many languages as possible.
